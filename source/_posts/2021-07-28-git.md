### gitlab ci/cd

### backbone.js

view, model 두가지가 존재.

```
// view
Backbone.View.extend({});

// model
Backbone.Model.extend({});
```

terminal 에서 open . 하면 파인더에 현재 디렉토리로 열린다. 이거 유용할듯.

```
<script type="text/template" id="search_template"> 이런식으로 script 태그에 id를 지정하고 이를 템플릿으로 활용하는거 같음.
```



### underscore.js


1. Backbone.Model
  - initialize : 초기화 model new 생성시 자동 호출 
  - save : 서버로 전송
  - fetch : 서버에서 가져오기
  - sync : 강제로 서버와 값을 맞춤 
  - id : 속성을 통하여 전송 아이디 설정가능 (MongoDB 를 사용하면 "idAttribute: _id" 로 설정한다)
  - defaults : model 객체의 기본값을 지정
  - validate : 데이터 정합성 체크
